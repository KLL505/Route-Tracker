# Route-Tracker

This program can take in a file that contains a series of locations and their routes to other destinations and implements 
this data into a weighted graph represented by an adjacency matrix. This program can then take in another file that contains
a list of drivers and their routes along these locations. The program can use this graph to determine if the drivers route is
valid and the total distance the driver will travel.
